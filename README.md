# MUAR

MUAR (derived from the Spanish: Máster en Automática y Robótica) compiles the key assignments for the 2023-24 academic year within the **Master's in Robotics** program at the Polytechnic University of Madrid.

## 1. Maths

### 1.1 Graphs

Solutions to common graph problems implemented using the `NetworkX` Python library within `Jupyter Notebooks`. The following problems are addressed:

- **TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem)**: Finding the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city.
- **CPP (Chinese Postman Problem)**: Determining the shortest possible route that visits every edge of a graph at least once.
- **SPP (Shortest Path Problem)**: Calculating the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
- **MST (Minimum Spanning Tree)**: Finding the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph.

#### Folder Structure

- **Data**: This folder contains datasets for four large graphs used.
- **src.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook file that contains the Python code for solving the graph problems.
- **Assignment_guide.pdf**: Detailed instructions and descriptions for the graphs used.
- **Graphs_Problems.pdf**: Presentation slides.

Finally, an example of the TSP solution for a graph with 100 nodes.
